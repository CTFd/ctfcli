# Changelog

# 0.1.2 / 2023-02-26

### Added

- Before uploading files to CTFd, ctfcli will check for CTFd's SHA1 hash of the previously uploaded file and skip uploading if it is the same
- Support using remote Docker images instead of having to build and push local images

# 0.1.1 / 2023-12-11

### Added

- Added `ctf challenge mirror` command to pull changes from the remote CTFd instance into the local project

### Fixed

- Properly include challenge.yml when generating a challenge from a template

### Changed

- No longer require a ctfcli project to run all `ctf challenge` (e.g. `new`, `format`, `lint`)

# 0.1.0 / 2023-10-03

### Added

- ctfcli has been separated into two main modules `cli` and `core`. The `core` module now packages logic previously found inside `utils`, wrapped into classes.
- The classes in the `core` module will only print out warnings instead of interrupting the whole process. Everything else will throw exceptions which can be caught and handled however desired
- `cli` and `core` internal modules have type hints
- Improved error messages
- Unit tests have been added for the entire `core` module
- ctfcli will now ask to initialize a new project if one does not exist
- Added `--hidden` to `ctf challenge install` which will deploy the challenge / challenges in a hidden state regardless of their `challenge.yml` value.
- Added `ctf challenge edit <name>` and `ctf challenge edit <name> --dockerfile` to open challenge.yml or Dockerfile for that challenge
- Added aliases under `ctf templates` and `ctf plugins` for `dir` (`path`) and for `view` (`show`)
- Progress bars for `ctf challenge deploy` / `ctf challenge install` / `ctf challenge sync`
- `ctf challenge deploy` will now deploy ALL deployable challenges if a specific challenge is not specified
  - For the SSH and Registry deployments, to facilitate this behaviour the challenge name will be automatically appended. So the host should be for example: `registry://registry.example.com/example-project` and the challenge name will be appended for a full location.
- `ctf challenge deploy` will now also automatically login to the registry with Cloud and Registry deployments.
  - For cloud deployments the instance url must be ctfd assigned (e.g. example.ctfd.io) - this is because to log-in to the registry we require a username like `admin@example.ctfd.io`. The deployment will use the access token as the password.
  - For registry deployment it will look for the `username` and `password` keys inside a `[registry]` section in the project config file.
- ctfcli will read a `LOGLEVEL` environment variable to enable DEBUG logging has been added

### Fixed

- When syncing a challenge to a remote instance, state specified in challenge.yml will now be ignored to prevent accidental challenge leaking
- The CLI will now exit with a 0 if everything went right, and 1 if something went wrong.
  - With `install`/`sync`/`deploy` - exit code will be 1 if ANY of the challenges failed to `install`/`sync`/`deploy`.

### Changed

- Built using poetry and `pyproject.toml`
- `python-fire` has been updated to 0.5.0

### Changed

- Allow empty string in CTFd URL and CTFd access token values for `ctf init`
